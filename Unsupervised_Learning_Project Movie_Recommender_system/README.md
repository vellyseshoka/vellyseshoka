### Predict Overview: Movie Recommendation Challenge 2022

### Introduction

In todayâ€™s technology driven world, recommender systems are socially and economically critical for ensuring that individuals can make appropriate choices surrounding the content they engage with on a daily basis. One application where this is especially true surrounds movie content recommendations; where intelligent algorithms can help viewers find great titles from tens of thousands of options.

With this context, we as EDSA students have constructucted a recommendation algorithm based on content or collaborative filtering, capable of accurately predicting how a user will rate a movie they have not yet viewed based on their historical preferences.

Providing an accurate and robust solution to this challenge has immense economic potential, with users of the system being personalised recommendations - generating platform affinity for the streaming services which best facilitates their audience's viewing.

The evaluation metric for this model is Root Mean Square Error. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is commonly used in regression analysis and forecasting, and measures the standard deviation of the residuals arising between predicted and actual observed values for a modelling process. For our task of generating user movie ratings via recommendation algorithms.

### Data Description
This dataset consists of several million 5-star ratings obtained from users of the online MovieLens movie recommendation service. The MovieLens dataset has long been used by industry and academic researchers to improve the performance of explicitly-based recommender systems.

**Source:**

The data for the MovieLens dataset is maintained by the GroupLens research group in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. Additional movie content data was legally scraped from IMDB.

**Supplied Files:**
* genome_scores.csv - a score mapping the strength between movies and tag-related properties. Read more here
* genome_tags.csv - user assigned tags for genome-related scores
* imdb_data.csv - Additional movie metadata scraped from IMDB using the links.csv file.
* links.csv - File providing a mapping between a MovieLens ID and associated IMDB and TMDB IDs.
* sample_submission.csv - Sample of the submission format for the hackathon.
* tags.csv - User assigned for the movies within the dataset.
* test.csv - The test split of the dataset. Contains user and movie IDs with no rating data.
* train.csv - The training split of the dataset. Contains user and movie IDs with associated rating data.

**Additional Information:**

The below information is provided directly from the MovieLens dataset description files:

#### Ratings Data File Structure (train.csv)

* All ratings are contained in the file train.csv. Each line of this file after the header row represents one rating of one movie by one user, and has the following format:
userId,movieId,rating,timestamp
The lines within this file are ordered first by userId, then, within user, by movieId.

* Ratings are made on a 5-star scale, with half-star increments (0.5 stars - 5.0 stars).

* Timestamps represent seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970.

#### Tags Data File Structure (tags.csv)

* All tags are contained in the file tags.csv. Each line of this file after the header row represents one tag applied to one movie by one user, and has the following format:
userId,movieId,tag,timestamp
* The lines within this file are ordered first by userId, then, within user, by movieId.
* Tags are user-generated metadata about movies. Each tag is typically a single word or short phrase. The meaning, value, and purpose of a particular tag is determined by each user.

* Timestamps represent seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970

#### Movies Data File Structure (movies.csv)

* Movie information is contained in the file movies.csv. Each line of this file after the header row represents one movie, and has the following format:
movieId,title,genres
Movie titles are entered manually or imported from https://www.themoviedb.org/, and include the year of release in parentheses. Errors and inconsistencies may exist in these titles.

* Genres are a pipe-separated list, and are selected from the following:
Action
Adventure
Animation
Children's
Comedy
Crime
Documentary
Drama
Fantasy
Film-Noir
Horror
Musical
Mystery
Romance
Sci-Fi
Thriller
War
Western
(no genres listed)

#### Links Data File Structure (links.csv)

Identifiers that can be used to link to other sources of movie data are contained in the file links.csv. Each line of this file after the header row represents one movie, and has the following format:

* movieId is an identifier for movies used by https://movielens.org. E.g., the movie Toy Story has the link https://movielens.org/movies/1.

* imdbId is an identifier for movies used by http://www.imdb.com. E.g., the movie Toy Story has the link http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/.

* tmdbId is an identifier for movies used by https://www.themoviedb.org. E.g., the movie Toy Story has the link https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/862.

#### Tag Genome (genome-scores.csv and genome-tags.csv)

* As described in this article, the tag genome encodes how strongly movies exhibit particular properties represented by tags (atmospheric, thought-provoking, realistic, etc.). The tag genome was computed using a machine learning algorithm on user-contributed content including tags, ratings, and textual reviews.

* The genome is split into two files. The file genome-scores.csv contains movie-tag relevance data in the following format:

* The second file, genome-tags.csv, provides the tag descriptions for the tag IDs in the genome file, in the following format:
tagId,tag
